# Shakespeare-Bot
The objective of this project is to train a generative language model capable of producing original text in the style of Shakespeare. To achieve this, we will implement and compare two types of models: a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a transformer-based model. 

The RNN serves as a baseline due to its simplicity, while the transformer offers a modern, attention-based approach known for superior performance in capturing long-range dependencies in text. This comparison allows us to evaluate the trade-offs between model complexity, training efficiency, and generation quality in the context of text generation.

This project focuses on a structured dataset of Shakespearean plays, containing over 100,000 lines of dialogue attributed to individual characters across various works. Each line is accompanied by metadata including the play title, act and scene identifiers, and speaker information.
